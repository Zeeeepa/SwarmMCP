# Security Guide for Unified MCP Server

This guide outlines security considerations for deploying and operating the Unified MCP Server.

## Network Security

### HTTPS

Always use HTTPS for all communication with the Unified MCP Server. This can be configured using:

- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination
- Kubernetes Ingress with TLS
- AWS Application Load Balancer with TLS

### Firewall

Configure a firewall to restrict access to the Unified MCP Server:

- Allow only necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443)
- Allow only necessary IP addresses
- Block all other traffic

### Network Policies

If using Kubernetes, configure network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: unified-mcp-server
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: unified-mcp-server
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3000
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### API Authentication

Implement API authentication using:

- JWT tokens
- API keys
- OAuth 2.0

### User Authentication

Implement user authentication using:

- Username and password with bcrypt
- OAuth 2.0 with Google, GitHub, etc.
- SAML for enterprise SSO

### Authorization

Implement authorization using:

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Resource-based access control

## Data Security

### Encryption at Rest

Encrypt sensitive data at rest using:

- Disk encryption
- Database encryption
- Field-level encryption

### Encryption in Transit

Encrypt data in transit using:

- HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- mTLS for service-to-service communication
- VPN for remote access

### Secrets Management

Manage secrets using:

- Kubernetes Secrets
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring

Monitor for security events using:

- Prometheus alerts
- ELK stack with security rules
- AWS CloudWatch with security rules

### Audit Logging

Implement audit logging for security events:

- User authentication
- API access
- Resource modification

### Intrusion Detection

Implement intrusion detection using:

- Network-based intrusion detection
- Host-based intrusion detection
- Anomaly detection

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning

Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using:

- npm audit
- Snyk
- GitHub Dependabot

### Container Scanning

Scan containers for vulnerabilities using:

- Docker Scan
- Trivy
- Clair

### Code Scanning

Scan code for vulnerabilities using:

- ESLint with security rules
- SonarQube
- GitHub CodeQL

## Compliance

### GDPR

Ensure GDPR compliance by:

- Implementing data protection measures
- Providing data export functionality
- Implementing data deletion functionality

### SOC 2

Ensure SOC 2 compliance by:

- Implementing security controls
- Documenting security policies
- Conducting security audits

### HIPAA

Ensure HIPAA compliance by:

- Implementing PHI protection measures
- Implementing access controls
- Implementing audit logging

## Incident Response

### Incident Detection

Detect security incidents using:

- Prometheus alerts
- ELK stack with security rules
- AWS CloudWatch with security rules

### Incident Response Plan

Develop an incident response plan:

- Define roles and responsibilities
- Define communication procedures
- Define containment procedures
- Define eradication procedures
- Define recovery procedures

### Post-Incident Analysis

Conduct post-incident analysis:

- Document the incident
- Identify root causes
- Implement preventive measures
